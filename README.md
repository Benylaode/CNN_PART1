### CNN Feature Extraction Program

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for feature extraction from image data. The project focuses on utilizing CNN layers to capture and learn important patterns and features that can be used for various tasks, such as classification, image analysis, and further processing.

#### Features:
- **Input Preprocessing**: Functions to load and preprocess image datasets.
- **CNN Model**: A CNN architecture that includes convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for robust feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction**: After training, the model can be used to extract features from new images by removing the final classification layer.
- **Customization**: The architecture can be easily customized for different datasets and tasks by modifying the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the extracted features and intermediate CNN layers, providing insights into how the model is learning.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on framework choice)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

#### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Load your dataset and configure the CNN model.
4. Train the model and use the provided utilities to extract and visualize features.
